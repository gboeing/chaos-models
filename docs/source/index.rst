   pynamical

pynamical is a Python package for modeling, simulating, visualizing, and animating discrete nonlinear dynamical 
systems and chaos. It uses pandas, numpy, and numba for fast simulation, and matplotlib for beautiful visualizations 
and animations to explore system behavior. Compatible with Python 2 and 3.
